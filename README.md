A machine learning project focused on predicting sales for a retail store chain using historical sales data. 
This solution leverages data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and regression models to forecast future sales and support better business decisions.

**Features**
- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world retail data with missing values and categorical variables.

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations to understand sales trends and product behavior.

- Trained machine learning models for regression to predict item outlet sales.

- Evaluated model performance using metrics like RÂ² score and RMSE.

**Technologies Used**
- Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

- Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest
